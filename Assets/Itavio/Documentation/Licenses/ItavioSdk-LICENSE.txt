11.	 	Confidentiality and Confidential Information 

“Confidential Information” means information or material provided by the disclosing party (the “Discloser”) to the recipient (the “Recipient”) that is in tangible form and labeled “confidential” or the like, or, information, which a reasonable person knew or should have known to be confidential. The following information shall be considered Confidential Information whether or not marked or identified as such: (a) license keys; (b) information regarding Itavio pricing, product roadmaps and strategic marketing plans; (c) non-public materials relating to the SDK or Itavio products, and (d) this Agreement. You shall keep all Confidential Information you receive confidential using the same protections that you apply to your own information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, and may use such information solely for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing. Confidential Information may be disclosed solely to employees, contractors and consultants who have a legitimate need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality restrictions substantially equivalent to this Section 11 and who are not working on projects, products or services that are competitive with Itavio’s and its affiliates’ projects, products and services. This section will not apply to information that: (a) was rightfully in possession of the Recipient prior to receipt of such Confidential Information from the Discloser; (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the Recipient; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (d) is independently developed by Recipient without breach of any confidentiality obligations; (e) is disclosed by Recipient with Discloser’s written approval; (f) the Recipient is required to disclose by applicable law or court order, or (g) in confidence, in connection with an actual or proposed merger, acquisition, or similar transaction. In addition, Recipient will be allowed to disclose (i) Discloser’s Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or by the order of a court or similar judicial or administrative body, provided that Recipient notifies Discloser of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with Discloser, at Discloser’s request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure, and (ii) the terms and conditions of this Agreement in confidence in connection with an actual or proposed merger, acquisition, or similar transaction. The parties acknowledge that breach of this section 11 may cause irreparable damage to the Discloser for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Discloser will be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive and any relief (legal or equitable) to restrain any breach or anticipated breach of this section 11. No party has the right to issue media releases, public announcements or public disclosures relating to the existence of or the terms of this Agreement or use the other party’s name in any promotional or marketing material (other than as required by legal, accounting or regulatory requirements).


12.	 	Indemnity 

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Itavio, its employees, officers and directors, or users from and against any and all claims, liabilities, penalties, settlements, judgments, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (i) any information that you or anyone using your account may submit or access in the course of using the Services; (ii) your breach of any representation or warranty in, or violation of the terms of this Agreement or any agreement or other instrument with a third party applicable to you; (iii) any violation or failure by you or your partners to comply with all laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Services, whether or not described herein; and (iv) any disputes between you and your customers, partners, advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or publishers. 


13.	  	Third Parties

You acknowledge and agree that Itavio (i) is not responsible for the availability of or access to any such third-party websites or resources, (ii) does not endorse you, your products or services, or any advertising, products or other materials available on or from such 

third-party websites or resources, and (iii) is not liable for any loss or damage which you may have incurred as a result of the availability of any third-party website or resources, or lack thereof, or your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of any advertising, products or other resources from such third-parties.

IN NO EVENT WILL ITAVIO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “ITAVIO PARTIES”), BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY UNDER ANY THEORY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST INCOME, REVENUE OR PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ITAVIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE. THE ITAVIO PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, THE ITAVIO PARTIES’ LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE EFFICACY OF THE SDK AND SERVICES ARE DIRECTLY AND SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON YOUR CAREFUL AND DILIGENT INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE SDK AND SERVICES AS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED IN SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Itavio’s acquiescence in the breach of a provision of this Agreement or failure to act upon such breach does not waive Itavio’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

You and Itavio (for the purposes of this section 20, either one the “Disputing Party”, the “Receiving Party”, and each the “Party” or “Parties”) shall first attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures specified below:

The notice and the response shall include (i) a statement of such Party’s position and a summary of arguments supporting the position, and (ii) the name and title of the executive who will represent the Party and any other person who will accompany the executive. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Disputing Party’s notice, the executives of both Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute. All reasonable requests for information made by one Party to the other will be honored;

ii.	If the matter has not been resolved within sixty (60) days after the Disputing Party’s initial notice, or if the Parties fail to meet within thirty (30) days of such notice, either Party may initiate mediation of the controversy or claims as provided below in subsection (iii) of this section 20;

iii.	If the dispute has not been resolved by negotiation as provided above, the Parties shall endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation under the then current Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (Canada Rules).

iv.	All negotiations pursuant to this section 20 are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of any applicable laws; and
